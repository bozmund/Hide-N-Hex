## Overview 
Hide ‘N Hex is a single player resource crafting simulation game developed in Unity. The art style is pixelated, inspired by many modern pixel games such as Celeste and Stardew Valley. This retro-style game is set in the medieval times during which witch-hunts and witch trials were commonplace.  

The main character is thrown into the action when her grandmother, on her deathbed, reveals that they are both witches. She leaves her cottage to her grandchild and sends her on a mission to stop the witch-trials. 

## The Story
In the quiet, misty woods of the Silverwoods, there stood an old cottage, enveloped in tales of mystique and magic. This cottage was once the home of a woman known throughout the nearby village, commonly known as Crescent Vale, as Granny Willow, a revered healer and wise woman whispered to possess extraordinary powers. 

 

One day, a darkness descended upon the Silverwoods, casting a shadow over its once tranquil beauty. It began with whispers among the villagers, rumors of a sickness spreading like wildfire. Granny Willow, ever the compassionate healer, ventured out to aid those afflicted, her heart heavy with concern for her people.  

 

But as the days stretched into weeks, the sickness only worsened, its grip tightening around the throats of the villagers like a vise. Despite Granny Willow's best efforts, her potions proved powerless against the relentless onslaught of the disease.  

In this turmoil, a wave of fear and hysteria swept through the village, fueled by desperation and uncertainty. Blinded by panic, the villagers turned on Granny Willow, accusing her of bringing the plague upon them with her witchcraft.  

 

In the dead of night, the mob descended upon Granny Willow's cottage, their torches casting eerie shadows against the darkened trees. With cries of anger and hatred, they dragged Granny Willow from her home, accusing her of consorting with dark forces and bringing doom upon their village. The only reason they didn’t end her life was because one of the villagers sacrificed himself in her stead. Granny Willow never returned.  

 

Misty was just a small child when Granny Willow came to live at her home. Only later would she find out her misfortunate fate. One fateful day, on Granny’s deathbed, Granny Willow revealed that they are both witches. 

 

After Granny Willow's passing, the responsibility of tending to her legacy fell upon her granddaughter, Misty. Misty had always felt a pull toward the secluded cottage, drawn by the whispers of secrets locked within its timbers. Little did she know, her destiny awaited her amidst the cobwebbed cupboards and tattered hardwood floors.  

 

Misty could not believe the truth of her heritage until the day she stumbled upon Granny Willow's hidden chamber, concealed behind a secret door in the form of a bookshelf.  

Within the chamber lay the ancient potion book of her grandmother, its pages filled with arcane symbols and forgotten incantations.
